Your Cloudinary name will be visible on the 'Account' screen:\r\n\r\n![](img/01.png)\r\n\r\nOn the 'Security' panel, scroll to the end and take note of the `Access Keys' (blacked out here):\r\n\r\n![](img/02.png)\r\n\r\nThe `API Secret' normally displays as asterisks. If you click on them, the actual code will be revealed.\r\n\r\n**Note:** This information is also available on the `Dashboard`.\r\n\r\n![](img/05.png)\r\n\r\n"
